# Javascript Weight Tracker
Just quick little project to learn how this webdev thing works :)  
*Bootstrap, Javascript(+chartist.js)*

## Demo
https://kasmilus.github.io/WeightTracker/index.html

## Issues
It is just a short project hosted on github pages so no database, users are hard coded.

## Credits
I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYq9J-Eur9U) tutorial as a starting point.
